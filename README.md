## Coffee Sales Dashboard Overview
This dashboard visualizes sales data for a coffee business, showcasing trends, geographic performance, customer analysis, and product preferences. It integrates various data transformations and Excel features to make the insights interactive and insightful.

## Data Source and Structure
The raw data used for this dashboard included the following columns:

- Customer Information: Customer ID, Customer Name, Email, Country

- Product Details: Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size, Unit Price, Coffee Type Name, Roast Type Name

  
- Sales and Loyalty: Sales, Loyalty Card
  
The data was transformed and enriched using formulas like XLOOKUP and INDEX to pull relevant details and maintain consistency.

## Data Processing and Transformations

- Pivot Tables:

Pivot tables were created to summarize sales, customers, and product performance. Metrics such as total sales by country, customer, and product type were computed.

- Data Cleaning:

Columns were cleaned for missing or inconsistent values.
Calculations such as total sales (Sales = Quantity Ã— Unit Price) were verified.

- Formula Usage:

- XLOOKUP: Used for retrieving related data, such as pulling customer details based on Customer ID or product details based on Product ID.
